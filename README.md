Short Description
This project outlines a simulated one-sprint Scrum process for building a cloud-based task management application, focusing on features for task creation, assignment to users, and progress tracking. Our group has detailed the team roles, planned key Scrum ceremonies and artifacts, curated a product backlog with essential items, defined a clear sprint objective, and established quality criteria via the Definition of Done.
